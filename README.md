Just for the sake of it, I went for react and totally overengineered the thing... But it was good practice and a fun project to make.
Things to note : I went for simple hooks to manage card state. It's a bit ugly but bringing in a store manager would have been way too much for a simple UI that's not destined to be put to prod or anything.
Also : I'm sure there's tons of hardcoded values & unoptimized stuff left, but since the goal was to go as fast as possible well... Here goes :P
